## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- `bash` (For running the shell script)
- `a2ps` (For converting text to PostScript)
- `ps2pdf` (For converting PostScript to PDF)
  
#### On Debian-based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint):
Run the following command to install both `a2ps` and `ps2pdf`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install a2ps ps2pdf
```

#### On Red Hat-based Systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora, RHEL):
Use `dnf` or `yum` to install the required tools:

```bash
sudo dnf install a2ps ghostscript
```
or

```bash
sudo dnf install a2ps ghostscript
```

### Running the Script
1. **Clone the Repository**

  If you're using Git, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AuditAnalyzer.git 
cd AuditAnalyzer
```

2. **Make the Script Executable**

Ensure the script is executable. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
   chmod +x AuditAnalyzer.sh
  ```

3. **Run the Script**
    To run the script, execute it with:
```bash
./AuditAnalyzer.sh

```
* The script will generate a detailed audit report and store it in a text file.
* You will be prompted to provide a filename for the PDF report.
* The script will convert the text report into a PDF file using `a2ps` and `ps2pdf`.

**Example output prompt:**

```bash
Enter the desired name for the PDF report (without extension): MyAuditReport
```

4. **Report Files**

* The generated audit report will be saved as a text file with a timestamp.
* If you choose to generate a PDF report, the script will save it with the filename you provided (e.g., `MyAuditReport.pdf`).
* Both the text and PDF reports will contain detailed information about the system's performance, network statistics, user activity, and more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
**2. User Activity**

```bash
Currently logged in users:
user1   pts/0        192.168.1.5    2024-11-05 10:30
root    pts/1        192.168.1.5    2024-11-05 10:32
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last logged in users (last 10):
user1   tty1         2024-11-04 09:00
root    tty1         2024-11-04 09:05
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**3. System Resource Usage**
```bash
Disk Space Usage:
Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       10240000  5120

000  5120000  50% /

Memory Usage:
total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          16GB        8GB        4GB        1GB         4GB

## PDF Download Advantage
After generating the report using the script, you have the option to download a PDF version of the audit report. This PDF can be shared with other administrators or team members for documentation purposes. Itâ€™s helpful for generating formal audit records that can be stored or presented as part of system administration reviews.

**Advantages of the PDF:**

* **Professional Format:** The PDF provides a clean and formatted report for documentation.
* **Portability:** A PDF is a universally accepted format that can be opened on almost any device. 
* **Archiving:** PDFs are ideal for archiving as they preserve the layout and integrity of the report.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are some common solutions:

1. **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure `a2ps` and `ps2pdf` are installed on your system. If the script fails to generate the PDF, verify that these tools are available in your   `$PATH`

2. **Permission Issues:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the script and access the required system files.

3. **Invalid Command:** If a command used in the script is unavailable (e.g., netstat, ss, uptime), you may need to install additional utilities specific to your system.
